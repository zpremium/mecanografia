# Mecanography 

It's a Mecanography game where you need to write the same text without errors and being the most fast as you can. The border of the text-area it will show you if you doing great or not, if you're doing right, the border will be blue, but if you're not doing it right the border will be red.... but if you completed the border will be green.

## Lessons Learned

It was very interesting this project, because i thought it will be more difficult then I thought.
I Learned you can use style in JavaScript, to be more specific, in the border I had to used an IF- ELSE IF -ELSE, if you start writing and its right the border will be blue, but if u write something no right the border will be red, but if u finised the border will be green.
